# Football_Penalty_Line_Detection
This code uses hough transform to detect the white lines of the football field.
Through this code you can either use trackbar to set the parameter of upper and lower threshold or you can use the parameters which I have specified. This is quite a generic code and will work for most of the pictures of the football field.
